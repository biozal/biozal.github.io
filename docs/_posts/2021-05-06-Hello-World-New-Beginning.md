## Unveiling & Release
2020 was a year that I don't think anyone will forget.  For many of us it forced us to learn how to do our jobs, hobbies, and deal with our personal lives in a different, somewhat foreign way.  Wither you were working from home for the first time, home schooling your children, or trying to find work - it was a rough year for all of us.  The end of 2020 was a very large strain and forced me to rethink what I want to do with my career and hobbies.

In April of 2021 I said goodbye to my friends at EY.  I greatly enjoyed working at EY for 5 and a half years as a technical lead for the Mobile Technologies team making amazing mobile apps and building things I never dreamed of in my career.  In the middle of 2020, I took over as the lead for the developer experience â€“ leading the team of developer advocates on trying to make software development better.  In my time at EY I was involved in a wide range of technology from AR, VR to drones and complex cloud-based services. 

While I enjoyed a management role, the leadership role I was in required attending more and more meetings and I was spending less and less time helping developers.  I wanted a change - the ability to go back to helping developers build amazing things.  I'm a developer at heart and this is what I love doing more than anything else.  The instant gratification of seeing something you worked on running on a mobile phone also made me want to focus on mobile platforms.

With all these goals in mind it made it clear I was going to need to move on and start a new journey.  I recently joined an amazing team of Developer Advocates at Couchbase, focusing on mobile, desktop, and edge-based technologies.  With this change I now have the time to focus on new ways to connect with developers.  This includes but isn't limited to a new website, a new blog, starting up my video channel on YouTube, and live streaming on YouTube and Twitch.  

The focus of all content I will be producing is going to be largely around helping developers and solution architects of all ages and skillsets sharing knowledge I have gained working as a software developer over the past 28 years.  I'll have content for mobile developers in .NET, native (Kotlin/Swift), and React Native, web development content in .NET, Springboot (Java/Kotlin), Vue/React, and desktop developers in .NET, Java/Kotlin.  I'll also be sneaking in some IoT demos and playing around with some cool IoT hardware.

I'm excited for the future and what it can bring.  I'm very grateful to my new employer Couchbase for allowing me to get more involved with the larger development communities in the technology stacks I love coding in.  I hope you join me in this journey.  The blog will see new postings weekly and new video content will start at the end of May 2021.
